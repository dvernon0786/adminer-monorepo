## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Check system status:**
   ```bash
   ./adminer.sh status
   ```

2. **Validate before changes:**
   ```bash
   ./adminer.sh validate
   ```

3. **Fix any issues:**
   ```bash
   ./adminer.sh fix
   ```

4. **Deploy to production:**
   ```bash
   ./adminer.sh deploy
   ```

5. **Test deployment:**
   ```bash
   ./adminer.sh smoke-test production
   ```

./adminer.sh validate

# Test locally
./adminer.sh smoke-test local
```

### Pre-deployment
```bash
# Fix any issues
./adminer.sh fix

# Validate everything
./adminer.sh validate

# Deploy
./adminer.sh deploy
```

### Post-deployment
