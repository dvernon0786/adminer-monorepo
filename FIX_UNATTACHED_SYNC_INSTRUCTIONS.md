# ðŸ”§ Fix Unattached Sync Issue

## Problem Identified
The Inngest Cloud dashboard shows "Unattached syncs" because the API endpoint response format doesn't match what Inngest Cloud expects.

## Solution Applied
Updated the `/api/inngest` endpoint to return the proper format that Inngest Cloud recognizes.

## Changes Made
1. **Backed up original endpoint**: `api/inngest.js.backup`
2. **Updated endpoint format**: Now returns `functions` array directly
3. **Maintained all functionality**: All 5 functions still properly defined

## Next Steps

### 1. Deploy the Updated Endpoint
```bash
# Commit and push the changes
git add adminer/apps/api/api/inngest.js
git commit -m "Fix Inngest endpoint format for proper sync"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Wait for Deployment
- Wait 2-3 minutes for Vercel to deploy the changes
- Verify the endpoint is updated

### 3. Test the Updated Endpoint
```bash
curl -X PUT https://adminer-api.vercel.app/api/inngest
```

Expected response format:
```json
{
  "functions": [...],
  "appId": "adminer-jobs",
  "appName": "Adminer Job Pipeline"
}
```

### 4. Sync with Inngest Cloud
1. Go to: https://app.inngest.com
2. Click "Sync new app" or "Resync" existing app
3. Use URL: `https://adminer-api.vercel.app/api/inngest`
4. Wait for sync to complete

### 5. Verify Success
- Check that "Unattached syncs" disappears
- Verify "adminer-jobs" app appears in Apps list
- Confirm all 5 functions are visible

## Troubleshooting

### If sync still fails:
1. **Check endpoint format**: Ensure response has `functions` array
2. **Verify deployment**: Make sure changes are live on Vercel
3. **Check Inngest logs**: Look for specific error messages
4. **Try manual sync**: Use the Inngest Cloud dashboard

### If functions don't appear:
1. **Wait 2-3 minutes**: Sync can take time
2. **Check app ID**: Ensure it's "adminer-jobs"
3. **Verify environment**: Make sure you're in the right environment
4. **Check signing key**: Ensure INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY is set

## Rollback (if needed)
```bash
# Restore original endpoint
cp adminer/apps/api/api/inngest.js.backup adminer/apps/api/api/inngest.js
git add adminer/apps/api/api/inngest.js
git commit -m "Rollback Inngest endpoint"
git push origin main
```

## Expected Result
After following these steps:
- âœ… "Unattached syncs" should disappear
- âœ… "adminer-jobs" app should appear in Apps list
- âœ… All 5 functions should be visible and active
- âœ… Job creation should trigger Inngest functions
