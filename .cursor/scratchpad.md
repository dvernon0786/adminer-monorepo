## Lessons

### üéì **Key Learnings from Implementation:**

#### **1. Dual-Mode Architecture Benefits**
- **Development Mode**: Enables testing without real authentication tokens
- **Production Mode**: Provides enterprise-grade security
- **Seamless Switching**: Environment variable controls the mode
- **Zero Risk**: Can test production logic locally

#### **2. Clerk JWT Integration Best Practices**
- **JWKS Verification**: Use Clerk's public keys for token verification
- **Custom Claims**: Leverage JWT template for org context
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for authentication failures
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support prevents runtime errors

#### **3. Quota System Design**
- **Plan-Based Limits**: Clear differentiation between Free/Pro/Enterprise
- **Automatic Enforcement**: 402 responses with upgrade information
- **Usage Tracking**: Monthly billing period calculations
- **Upgrade Flow**: Seamless transition between plans

#### **4. Testing Strategy**
- **Development Headers**: Mock authentication for local development
- **Production Tokens**: Real Clerk JWT testing for production validation
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All endpoints and business logic tested
- **Automated Validation**: GitHub Actions integration for CI/CD

### üö® **Common Issues and Solutions:**

#### **Import Path Resolution**
- **Issue**: `@/db` alias not working in different contexts
- **Solution**: Use relative paths (`../db/client`) for consistency
- **Lesson**: Relative paths are more reliable in complex monorepo structures

#### **Type Safety in Middleware**
- **Issue**: Undefined types causing runtime errors
- **Solution**: Proper null coalescing (`orgId || null`)
- **Lesson**: Always handle undefined cases explicitly in TypeScript

#### **Database Schema Alignment**
- **Issue**: Field names mismatch between code and schema
- **Solution**: Check actual schema file for correct field names
- **Lesson**: Database schema is the source of truth for field names

## Technical Architecture

### üèóÔ∏è **System Components:**

#### **1. Authentication Middleware (`withAuthAndQuota`)**
```typescript
// Production-ready middleware with Clerk JWT verification
export function withAuthAndQuota(
  handler: (req: Request, ctx: AuthContext) => Promise<Response>,
  opts: WithAuthOptions
)
```

**Features:**
- Clerk JWT verification via JWKS endpoint
- Org lookup and plan resolution
- Quota enforcement with 402 responses
- Upgrade URL integration for Dodo checkout

#### **2. Dual-Mode API Routes**
```typescript
// Automatic switching between development and production modes
export default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  if (isDevMode) {
    return developmentHandler(req, res);
  } else {
    return productionHandler(req, res);
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Development mode: Uses `x-dev-*` headers
- Production mode: Uses Clerk JWT tokens
- Seamless testing in both environments

#### **3. Quota Management System**
```typescript
const PLAN_LIMITS: Record<Plan, number> = {
  free: 10,        // Per-keyword limit
  pro: 500,        // Monthly limit
  enterprise: 2000 // Monthly limit
};
```

**Features:**
- Plan-based quota enforcement
- Monthly usage tracking
- Automatic upgrade prompts
- Graceful quota exceeded handling

### üîê **Security Features:**

#### **JWT Verification**
- **JWKS Endpoint**: Verifies tokens against Clerk's public keys
- **Custom Claims**: Extracts org context and user information
- **Token Validation**: Ensures authenticity and expiration

#### **Quota Enforcement**
- **Automatic Checks**: Validates quota before processing requests
- **Upgrade Flow**: Provides upgrade URLs when quota exceeded
- **Usage Tracking**: Monitors monthly consumption per organization
