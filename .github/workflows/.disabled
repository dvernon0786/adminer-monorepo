# GitHub Actions Disabled
# 
# All CI/CD workflows are now running locally using Act (GitHub Actions runner)
# 
# Local execution commands:
# - ./scripts/run-local-workflows.sh          # Run all workflows
# - ./scripts/run-monorepo-ci.sh             # Run monorepo CI
# - ./scripts/run-deploy-smoke.sh            # Run deploy and smoke tests
# - ./scripts/run-smoke-tests.sh             # Run smoke tests only
# - ./scripts/run-promote-smoke.sh           # Run promotion workflow
#
# Benefits of local execution:
# - No GitHub billing issues
# - Faster execution
# - Full control over environment
# - No rate limiting
# - Offline capability
