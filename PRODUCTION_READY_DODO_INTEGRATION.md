- **Production-grade security** with timing-safe signature verification
- **Flexible header parsing** for multiple signature formats (raw hex, t=timestamp,v1=hex)
- **Idempotency handling** via webhook_events table to prevent duplicate processing
- **Comprehensive event processing** for subscription lifecycle management
- **Error handling and logging** for production debugging
- **TypeScript compliance** with full type safety

### 2. Enhanced Database Schema
- **New billing fields** added to orgs table for comprehensive subscription tracking
- **Jobs table** for accurate quota usage monitoring and tracking
- **Enhanced webhook_events** with production-ready structure
- **Safe migration scripts** for database updates without data loss

### 3. Enhanced Quota System
- **Jobs-based tracking** for production accuracy and real-time usage monitoring
- **Billing period management** with proper date handling and period boundaries
- **Quota middleware** for automatic usage tracking and enforcement
- **402 status handling** for quota exceeded scenarios with upgrade prompts

### 4. Comprehensive Testing
- **Webhook test scripts** with signature verification testing
- **Quota system validation** scripts for endpoint testing
- **Test endpoints** for development and testing workflows
- **Automated testing** for all critical paths and edge cases

## üîß Technical Features

### Security Features
- **Timing-safe signature verification** using Node.js crypto.timingSafeEqual

- **Flexible header parsing** supporting multiple signature formats
- **Comprehensive error handling** with detailed logging

### Database Features
- **Idempotent operations** preventing duplicate webhook processing
- **Efficient queries** with proper indexing for performance

- **Quota middleware** for automatic usage tracking
- **Comprehensive quota information** including usage, limits, and upgrade URLs
- **Health check endpoints** for monitoring and validation

## üìÅ Files Created/Updated

### Enhanced Webhook Handler
- `apps/api/pages/api/dodo/webhook.ts` - Production-ready webhook with enhanced security

### Database Schema & Migration
- `apps/api/src/db/schema.ts` - Enhanced schema with new billing fields
- `apps/api/scripts/2025-01-22_billing.sql` - Safe migration script

### Enhanced Quota System
- `apps/api/src/lib/quota.ts` - Jobs-based quota tracking system
- `apps/api/src/lib/quota-middleware.ts` - Quota checking middleware

### Testing & Validation
- `adminer/scripts/test-webhook.sh` - Comprehensive webhook testing
- `adminer/scripts/test-quota.sh` - Quota system validation

### Environment Configuration
- All environment templates updated with webhook secrets
- Production and development configurations ready

## üöÄ How to Deploy

### 1. Database Migration
Run the migration script in your production database:

```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f adminer/apps/api/scripts/2025-01-22_billing.sql
```

### 2. Environment Variables
Ensure these environment variables are set in production:

```bash
# Dodo Webhook Configuration
DODO_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret_here
DODO_PRICE_PRO=your_pro_price_id_here
DODO_PRICE_ENTERPRISE=your_enterprise_price_id_here

# Billing Configuration
BILLING_ENABLED=true
```

### 3. Deploy Application
Deploy your application with the enhanced webhook and billing components.

### 4. Test Webhook
Use the test script to verify webhook functionality:

```bash
./adminer/scripts/test-webhook.sh
```

## üß™ Testing

### Webhook Testing
The webhook test script (`test-webhook.sh`) tests:
- ‚úÖ Subscription creation events
- ‚úÖ Subscription activation events
- ‚úÖ Invalid signature rejection
- ‚úÖ Quota status endpoints

### Quota System Testing
The quota test script (`test-quota.sh`) tests:
- ‚úÖ Quota status endpoints
- ‚úÖ Quota checking middleware
- ‚úÖ Job simulation and quota increment
- ‚úÖ Health check endpoints

### Manual Testing
- Test webhook signature verification with real Dodo signatures
- Verify quota tracking through job creation
- Test upgrade flows when quota is exceeded
- Monitor logs for any errors or issues

## üìä Monitoring & Maintenance

### Webhook Monitoring
- Monitor webhook event processing in logs
- Check webhook_events table for successful processing
- Verify signature verification is working correctly
- Monitor for any failed webhook attempts

### Quota Monitoring
- Track quota usage through jobs table
- Monitor billing period transitions
- Check for quota exceeded scenarios
- Verify upgrade flow functionality

### Performance Monitoring
- Monitor database query performance
- Check webhook processing times
- Verify quota calculation accuracy
- Monitor error rates and response times

## üîí Security Considerations

### Webhook Security
- **Signature verification** prevents unauthorized webhook calls
- **Idempotency** prevents duplicate processing attacks
- **Timestamp validation** prevents replay attacks
- **Comprehensive logging** for security auditing

### Quota Security
- **Authentication required** for all quota endpoints
- **Organization isolation** prevents cross-org quota access
- **Rate limiting** through quota enforcement
- **Secure upgrade flows** with proper validation

## üéØ Next Steps

### Immediate (Next 30 minutes)
1. **Run database migration** to update schema
2. **Set environment variables** for webhook secrets
3. **Deploy application** with enhanced components

### Short-term (Next 2-4 hours)
