echo "🚀 Automated Bundle Sync Workflow Demo"
echo "======================================"

echo ""
echo "🎯 What This Achieves:"
echo "✅ Automatically rebuilds frontend before every deployment"
echo "✅ Ensures HTML and JavaScript bundle are always in sync"
echo "✅ Prevents bundle mismatch errors (like index-C0vUsXbH.js vs index-C6OjgTHQ.js)"
echo "✅ Eliminates need for manual dashboard_fix.sh runs"
echo "✅ Built into all CI/CD workflows"

echo ""
echo "🔧 How It Works:"
echo "1. GitHub Action 'sync-frontend-bundle' runs automatically"
echo "2. Cleans old dist/ and public/ directories"
echo "3. Runs 'npm run build' to generate fresh bundle"
echo "4. Copies dist/* to public/ directory"
echo "5. Verifies HTML references match actual bundle"
echo "6. Fails CI if mismatch detected"

echo ""
echo "📁 Files Updated:"
echo "✅ .github/actions/sync-frontend-bundle/action.yml (new reusable action)"
echo "✅ .github/workflows/deploy-wait-and-smoke.yml (uses action)"
echo "✅ .github/workflows/monorepo-ci.yml (uses action when deploying)"
echo "✅ .github/workflows/promote-and-smoke.yml (uses action)"

echo "🎉 Automated Bundle Sync Workflow Ready!"
echo ""
echo "💡 Benefits:"
echo "   • No more manual dashboard_fix.sh runs needed"
echo "   • Bundle mismatches automatically prevented"
echo "   • Every deployment guaranteed to have sync'd HTML/JS"
echo "   • Dashboard blank screen issues eliminated at source"

echo "🌐 Next deployment will automatically:"
echo "   1. Clean old files"
echo "   2. Build fresh frontend"
echo "   3. Sync to API public directory"
echo "   4. Verify bundle match"
echo "   5. Deploy with confidence"
