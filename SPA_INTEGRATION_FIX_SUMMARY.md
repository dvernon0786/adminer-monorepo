# SPA Integration Fix Summary

## What Was Fixed

The SPA integration was failing because Vite wasn't available in the Vercel build environment when the `spa:integrate` script tried to build the web app. This is a common issue in monorepos where only the `apps/api` workspace gets its dependencies installed.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `apps/web/package.json`
- ✅ Vite was already properly declared as a devDependency
- ✅ Updated Vite to stable version `^5.4.8`
- ✅ Updated TypeScript to stable version `^5.5.4`

### 2. Enhanced `apps/api/scripts/spa-integrate.cjs`
- ✅ Added preflight checks to verify `apps/web/package.json` exists and has correct build script
- ✅ Implemented robust fallback mechanism:
  - First attempts workspace build (`npm run build --workspace @adminer/web`)
  - If that fails, installs web deps directly (`npm install --prefix apps/web`) then builds
- ✅ Added post-build sanity checks to ensure `dist/` folder exists and isn't empty
- ✅ Improved error handling and logging
- ✅ Fixed asset path corrections for proper serving

### 3. Build Process
- ✅ No changes needed to Vercel build command
- ✅ Script automatically handles both local development and production environments
- ✅ Maintains existing `prebuild` → `build` → `spa:integrate` → `postbuild` flow

## How It Works Now

### Local Development
1. `npm ci` installs all workspace dependencies
2. `npm run -w @adminer/web build` works via workspace
3. `spa:integrate` copies `apps/web/dist/` → `apps/api/public/`

### Vercel Production
1. Vercel installs only `apps/api` dependencies
2. `spa:integrate` detects workspace build failure
3. Falls back to `npm install --prefix apps/web` + `npm run build --prefix apps/web`
4. Copies built SPA to `apps/api/public/`

## What to Expect in Next Deploy

✅ **Next.js builds successfully** (already working)
✅ **SPA integration succeeds** (either via workspace or direct install)
✅ **SPA served at `/` and `/dashboard`** from `apps/api/public/`
✅ **All billing and quota functionality preserved** (no changes to existing logic)

## Testing Locally

```bash
# From repo root
npm ci
npm run -w @adminer/web build            # Should produce apps/web/dist
npm run -w @adminer/api spa:integrate    # Should copy dist → apps/api/public
npm run -w @adminer/api postbuild        # Should validate SPA paths
```

## Verification Points

- `apps/api/public/index.html` exists
- `apps/api/public/assets/*` contains CSS and JS files
- `check-spa-paths.cjs` passes validation
- Asset paths in `index.html` are correctly formatted

## No Breaking Changes

All existing functionality remains intact:
- Billing system integration
- Quota management
- Clerk authentication
- Dodo payment processing
- Environment guards and checks

The fix is purely operational - ensuring the SPA builds and integrates correctly in all environments.
