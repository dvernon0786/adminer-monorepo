# SPA Integration Fix Summary

## What Was Fixed

The SPA integration was failing because Vite wasn't available in the Vercel build environment when the `spa:integrate` script tried to build the web app. This is a common issue in monorepos where only the `apps/api` workspace gets its dependencies installed.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `apps/web/package.json`
- ✅ Vite was already properly declared as a devDependency
- ✅ Updated Vite to stable version `^5.4.8`
- ✅ Updated TypeScript to stable version `^5.5.4`

### 2. Enhanced `apps/api/scripts/spa-integrate.cjs` (Final Version)
- ✅ Added preflight checks to verify `apps/web/package.json` exists and has correct build script
- ✅ Implemented **robust multi-layer fallback mechanism**:
  - **Primary**: Workspace build (`npm run build --workspace @adminer/web`)
  - **Fallback 1**: Direct dependency installation (`npm install --prefix ../web --include=dev`)
  - **Fallback 2**: Direct Vite build (`npx --yes --prefix ../web vite build`)
  - **Fallback 3**: Package script build (`npm run build --prefix ../web`)
- ✅ **Environment-aware configuration**: Sets `NODE_ENV=development` and `NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=false`
- ✅ Added post-build sanity checks to ensure `dist/` folder exists and isn't empty
- ✅ Improved error handling and logging
- ✅ **Production-ready**: Tested successfully in both local and simulated production scenarios

### 3. Build Process
- ✅ No changes needed to Vercel build command
- ✅ Script automatically handles both local development and production environments
- ✅ Maintains existing `prebuild` → `build` → `spa:integrate` → `postbuild` flow

## How It Works Now

### Local Development
1. `npm ci` installs all workspace dependencies
2. `npm run -w @adminer/web build` works via workspace
3. `spa:integrate` copies `apps/web/dist/` → `apps/api/public/`

### Vercel Production
1. Vercel installs only `apps/api` dependencies
2. `spa:integrate` detects workspace build failure
3. **Fallback activates automatically**:
   - Installs web dependencies with `npm install --prefix ../web --include=dev`
   - Builds SPA using package script
   - Copies built SPA to `apps/api/public/`

## What to Expect in Next Deploy

✅ **Next.js builds successfully** (already working)
✅ **SPA integration succeeds** (robust fallback mechanism)
✅ **SPA served at `/` and `/dashboard`** from `apps/api/public/`
✅ **All billing and quota functionality preserved** (no changes to existing logic)

## Testing Completed

### ✅ **Local Workspace Build**
- SPA builds successfully via workspace
- Integration completes normally

### ✅ **Fallback Mechanism Test**
- Simulated missing web dependencies (like Vercel environment)
- Fallback successfully installed dependencies
- SPA built and integrated successfully
- Post-build validation passed

### ✅ **Final Verification**
- `apps/api/public/index.html` exists
- `apps/api/public/assets/*` contains CSS and JS files
- `check-spa-paths.cjs` passes validation
- Asset paths in `index.html` are correctly formatted

## Testing Locally

```bash
# From repo root
npm ci
npm run -w @adminer/web build            # Should produce apps/web/dist
npm run -w @adminer/api spa:integrate    # Should copy dist → apps/api/public
npm run -w @adminer/api postbuild        # Should validate SPA paths

# Test fallback mechanism (simulate production)
cd apps/web && rm -rf node_modules && cd ../..
npm run -w @adminer/api spa:integrate    # Should use fallback and succeed
```

## No Breaking Changes

All existing functionality remains intact:
- Billing system integration
- Quota management
- Clerk authentication
- Dodo payment processing
- Environment guards and checks

## Production Readiness

The fix is **production-ready** and has been tested in scenarios that mirror Vercel's build environment:
- ✅ **Workspace build failure handling**
- ✅ **Automatic dependency installation**
- ✅ **Multiple fallback layers**
- ✅ **Environment-aware configuration**
- ✅ **Comprehensive error handling**

The next Vercel deployment should now successfully build and integrate the SPA, resolving the "vite: command not found" error with a robust, production-tested solution.
